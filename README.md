# bug-free-bassoon

Just my dotfiles... 
The first purpose of this hub is to be a backup for myself, but since I make
heavy use of other people's ideas, it just seems fair to share my own configs
back.

My system, and dependencies that might of might not be self-evident:

distro: gentoo (important "USE"-flags: python, lua... although I probably do'nt
need the extra libraries, it doesn't hurt .. also images-format, jpeg,etc)
wm: mostly qtile, working on my awesomewm config
editor: nvim (I uninstalled geany, might want to go back to it. emacs is there, 
but... I don't use it.)
terminal: kitty
filemanager: vifm and/or ranger, pcmanfm
sound: pulseaudio
browser: luakit, firefox, lynx
document-viewer: feh, geeqie, mupdf, zathura, 
graphics: gimp, inkscape (hardly ever use it)
python package-manager: pip


other dependencies:
dylanaraps/pywal, spicetify.
